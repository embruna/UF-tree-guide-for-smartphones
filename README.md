Guide to trees of UF campus for Android OS smartphones

This files and software were used to create the smartphone guide to trees of the UF campus described at http://brunalab.org/uf-campus-tree-guide-app/. The download link for the app is here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Ecology. The code was written by Subramaniam Arunachalam, the content was prepared by graduate students in a plant-animal interactions class, and the project was supervised by Emilio Bruna.

This code is being made available so that other research groups, students, and not-for profit institutions can use it to develop their own similar applications. Please contact Emilio Bruna if you use the code for your own project.
